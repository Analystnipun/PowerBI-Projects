# Power BI Sample Projects

Welcome to the **Power BI Sample Projects** repository! This repository contains various Power BI sample projects that I have created to learn and sharpen my Power BI skills. The data used in these projects is sourced from publicly available datasets found on the internet. These projects demonstrate my ability to analyze and visualize data effectively using Power BI.

## Project Overview

In this repository, you'll find different Power BI projects that focus on the following key areas:

- **Sales Forecasting**: Forecasting future sales based on historical sales data using Power BI’s built-in forecasting features and trend analysis.
- **Dashboard Creation**: Development of various dynamic and interactive dashboards that provide deep insights into business performance. These dashboards are designed for different scenarios such as sales, operations, customer segmentation, etc.
  
### Features

1. **Sales Forecasting**: 
   - The forecasting is based on previous sales trends to predict future sales.
   - Includes the use of Power BI’s time series forecasting tool to identify patterns and project future data.

2. **Interactive Dashboards**:
   - Dashboards with slicers, filters, and visuals like line charts, bar charts, pie charts, and KPIs.
   - Provides an intuitive and user-friendly experience for exploring and analyzing data.
   - Real-time updates to data when underlying datasets change.

3. **Data Insights**:
   - Data is analyzed and visualized to extract valuable insights that can inform decision-making.
   - Various metrics, such as total sales, average sales, sales growth, and others, are tracked and visualized.

4. **Trend Analysis**:
   - Use of line charts and other visual aids to display trends in sales over time.
   - Ability to identify seasonal trends, anomalies, and patterns.

## Prerequisites

- **Power BI Desktop** (Free version) or Power BI Pro (for sharing and collaboration features).
- A basic understanding of Power BI and its components (such as Data Model, Queries, DAX, and Visualizations).
  
## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Power BI files (`.pbix`) in **Power BI Desktop**.
3. Ensure the necessary data files (if any) are correctly linked in the Power BI project.
4. You can explore the dashboards and see how the sales forecasting models work. You may adjust filters and slicers to explore different data views.
